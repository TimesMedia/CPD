    <Question Question="1: The Society for Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes for South Africa recommends a target of &lt;7 % for HbA1c for the majority of patients, a fasting glucose of 4-7 mmol/L and a postprandial glucose of 5-10 mmol/L." QuestionId="3046" />
    <Question Question="2: The HbA1c target for elderly and frail patients has to be less stringent, to reduce the complications of hypoglycaemia. It is therefore important to take into account the individual patient’s age, complications, comorbidities and risk of hypoglycaemia when deciding about the target that should be aimed for." QuestionId="3047" />
    <Question Question="3: Early introduction of basal insulin is effective at keeping glucose levels within the target range with doses of &lt;0.4 U/kg/day, resulting in an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and excessive weight gain." QuestionId="3048" />
    <Question Question="4: Failure to start basal insulin may be due to several factors, including:" QuestionId="3049" />
    <Question Question="5: In insulin-naïve patients, psychological insulin resistance is common, and contributes to long delays in initiating insulin and extensive periods of hyperglycaemia." QuestionId="3050" />
    <Question Question="6: When the decision is made to initiate insulin therapy, it is advised to first target fasting glycaemia, as it contributes the most to HbA1c. This can be achieved by adding a basal insulin or insulin analogue to metformin, with or without the continuation of a sulphonylurea." QuestionId="3051" />

    <Question Question="2: Oestrogen-only preparations cause endometrial hyperplasia when used in women with intact uteri, and the longer the duration of unopposed oestrogen in these women, the higher the risk of their developing endometrial cancer." QuestionId="3059" />

    <Question Question="3: Elderly patients are more vulnerable to hypoglycaemia, due to impaired counter-regulatory mechanisms. Avoidance of hypoglycaemia is therefore an important consideration when deciding on treatment goals and choosing hypoglycaemic agents for the elderly." QuestionId="3066" />
