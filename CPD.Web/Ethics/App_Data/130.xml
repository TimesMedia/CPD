    <Question Question="2: It is of particular benefit to combine a GLP-1 receptor agonist and a DPP4-inhibitor as they work on the same pathway" QuestionId="3010" />
    <Question Question="3: The DPP4-inhibitors can be used in combination with other oral agents, but if used with sulphonylureas the risk of hypoglycaemia needs to be monitored carefully." QuestionId="3011" />
    <Question Question="4: Statin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus at moderate or high risk of CV-disease has been proven beyond doubt to have no benefit." QuestionId="3012" />
    <Question Question="5: Administration of at least one antihypertensive medication at bedtime has been shown to reduce CV-events in patients with DM and hypertension." QuestionId="3013" />
    <Question Question="6: Combination therapy is required in the majority of patients with DM and hypertension. At present, the recommendation is the use of an ACEI/ARB with a CCB, then the addition of a thiazide-like diuretic if required, followed by a loop diuretic, specifically spironolactone as fourth line.

  <Article Naam="Deep vein thrombosis">
    <Question Question="1: Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis may be mechanical or pharmacological. Pharmacological prophylaxis consists of unfractionated heparin (UH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, oral direct selective thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors."

    <Question Question="2: The benefits of low molecular weight heparin over unfractionated heparin include:" QuestionId="3022" />
    <Question Question="3: Dabigatran, an oral univalent direct thrombin inhibitor, requires laboratory monitoring due to its unpredictable anticoagulant effect." QuestionId="3023" />
    <Question Question="4: The goal of deep vein thrombosis treatment is to prevent the extension of thrombus and pulmonary embolism in the short term, and to prevent recurrent thrombotic events and late complications (pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome) in the long term." QuestionId="3024" />
    <Question Question="5: Monotherapy with heparin ab initio is insufficient due to the early prothrombotic tendency following heparin introduction, and warfarin must be used to initiate therapy." QuestionId="3025" />
